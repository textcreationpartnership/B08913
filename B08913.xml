            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE Deplorable CASE Of great Numbers of <hi>Suffering Subjects,</hi> concerned in the Ships and Veſſels employed in Their Majeſties <hi>Tranſport</hi>-Service: Humbly Offerred to the High COURT of PARLIAMENT Now Aſſembled.</head>
            <p>IN the beginning of the Year 1689. many Ships and Veſſels were hired into their Majeſties Service, to carry their Majeſties Land-Forces, with Arms, Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Stores and Proviſions for <hi>Ireland,</hi> in order to the reducing thereof; none departing the ſaid Service, until diſcharged by their Majeſties Officers, or loſt in the Service, and others of them are ſtill continued in the ſame to this very day.</p>
            <p>Several of the Maſters and Mariners of theſe Ships have died in this Service, through the Hardſhips which they have undergone therein.</p>
            <p>It has been the Unhappineſs of the Maſters, Owners and Proprietors, That after their Ships were hired they were called by the Name of TRANSPORT-SHIPS, (although ſeveral of them taken up by the Navy and Ordnance) whereby they have been denied the Benefit of any Money hitherto given for Payment of the Navy and Army; whereunto they were juſtly intitled (as they are advis'd.) So that the Owners and Proprietors of moſt of the Ships which are diſcharged the Service, have received very little of the Money due unto them for the ſame, more than a ſmall matter called Impreſt Money; paid to ſome few for one Month, to others for a Fortnight, but to many nothing at all.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Ships alſo that are ſtill continued in the Service have likewiſe received only ſome ſmall Impreſt Money, with a very little more, towards Subſiſtence, and moſt of that in Tallies upon the Fond of the double Ninepences Exciſe payable after Nine Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Sixty Thouſand Pounds; which, through the preſſing Neceſſities of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Owners, they have been conſtrained to receive and turn into ready Money at a very great Loſs.</p>
            <p>Theſe unhappy and unexpected Diſappointments have proved very fatal to moſt of the Owners and Proprietors, therein concerned; in that they have not only expended their ready Money, but contracted very many great Debts, in victualling their Ships, and paying their Seamens Wages, as far as they could. Several of them having been arreſted and impriſoned for the Debts contracted in this Service; and their Wives and Children thereby reduced to very great Neceſſities, and ſome to a begging Condition. Several of the Ships have alſo been arreſted and condemned by the Seamen for Wages due, and others lying in a periſhing Condition, for want of Money to repair them, to the utter diſabling of them in the way of their Trades. And this is the more deplorable, that in a greater or leſſer degree, it is the Caſe of all the Sea-Ports of this Kingdom, even from <hi>Whitehaven</hi> to <hi>Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed.</hi> The Summ total yet due, upon account of this Service, by the neareſt Computation, being betwixt Three and Four Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds.</p>
            <p>And whereas it has been ſuggeſted, That his Majeſty has been abuſed in the Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage or Burthen of the Ships and Veſſels imployed in this Service; the Owners have ſubmitted their Ships to an Admeaſurement, in obedience to his Majeſties Patent gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>John Bowles</hi> for that purpoſe; whereby it appears, that as there are ſeveral of their Ships that do under-meaſure, ſo there are many that do over-meaſure conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. Moreover, many of thoſe their Ships, as well Engliſh as Forreign built, that have under-meaſured, do really carry the Tonnage for which the Maſters hired them into this Service; as it appears by the Cuſtom-Houſe Books, that they have all along paid the King's Cuſtoms for ſo much Tonnage as they are lett for, if not more.</p>
